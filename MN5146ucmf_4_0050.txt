information, the latter for his willingness to undertake the publica-

of love than as a commercial undertaking.

l trust, too, that where Ι have rnade mistakes or come to con-
clusions, either textual or otherwise, that are or appear to be mis-
taken, the charitable reader will be so good as to point them out to
mein order that l may he enabled to correct the same in any
future edition.

nnn-ln the case of the Legenda Gregorii the text is collated
from the various MSS. known, and, in consequence, varies slightly
from any one text, though based more particularly on the London
Version.

The texts of the Legenda Antiqua and Truentus Secundus are
taken froin the Assisi and Boncompagni MSS. respectively.
Consequently where either of those MSS. contain errors of
grammar or spelling those errors are reproduced in order that, as

far as can be, the reader rnay he in possession of an accurate copy
of those two MSS.

The student of Franciscan sources will, douhtless, prefer to
make the necessary corrections for himself.
