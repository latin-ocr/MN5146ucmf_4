THOMAS OF CELANO Sa HIS WORKS

lNTRODUCTION

hv days when the revival of Franciscan studies has reached a
pitch of enthusiasm‚ which, if not unequalled‚ is at least of an
unusually active and searching kind, there is little need to

¹ apologise for placing before the student world the text of the most

important biographies upon which later writers have, almost without
exception, based their versions of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, and
we might add that of St. Clara of Assisi.

Until the present time the student of F ranciscan lore has not
been able to become possessed of the writings of Thomas of Celano
unless he were fortunate enough to secure the somewhat scarce
Italian versions by the Abbi} Amoni, or the still more scarce versions
published by Rinaldi.

It is true that those who could afford to purchase the
October volume of the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandist Fathers
were in possession of one version of a portion of the first life, but
this was all that even money could obtain, and in- consequence
the ordinary student has hitherto been unable to compare the
original text of the all-important biographies by Thomas of Celano
with the numerous works that have been pouring forth from the
press on. the subject of the life and character of St. Francis of
Assisi.

It has long been a matter of regret to students that the versions
of Celano’s lives, published at Rome by the Abbe Amoni, left

ἰ much to be desired, and even the Bollandist text of the so·called
“ Vita Prima ’³ in the ASS. is far from perfect.

A further fact, which tends to make the productiori of these

lives a matter of considerable interest, is that, since the publication
’ of all the works to which I have alluded, a series of interesting

and valuahle discoveries has been made, all of which have given
to the world material bearing directly upon the subject of Celano's

,3 Ἰ works, and indeed in certain cases have tended to supplement and
*ἶ correct the writings already known.
