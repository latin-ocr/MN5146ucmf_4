xxviii THOMAS OF CELANO

Beato Francisco, quae scripta non erant. Et scripsit pulcherrimum
librum, tam de miraculis quam de vita quem appelavit ‘Memorale
beati Francisci in disiderio animae.''’

We are thus face to face with these problems :-

What do the various writers mean by the Vita prima and
the Vita Secunda?

Is the Legenda Antiqua the same as the Vita Secunda or

not i
What is meant hythe “Pulcherrimus liber tam de miraculis

quam de vita ”?
To reply to these and many other difficulties, we shall have to
consider the MSS. themselves, and gather from them what we can

to elucidate the mystery.
Two documents only are at our disposal.

The first MS. we shall have to consider is that which is the
unique possession of the library at Assisi. It is unique in many
ways. It was until within the last five years the only known
version of the later writings of Thomas of Celano. It is different
in shape, style and nature from any of the former documents that
we have had under consideration.

Owing to the kindness of Professor Allesandro l was able
within the space of the ten days at my disposal to collate the work
which is now produced under the title of Legenda Antiqua. I
have also to thank him for his permission to photograph the MS,
which I trust may be reproduced in facsimile at some future date.

MSS. No. 686, Assisi, is written on vellum, measuring
142 >< 105 millimetres. The tiny document consists, however, of
102 pages, including the index which occupies some γὲ pages.

The writing is across the page, and not in two columns. lt
is certainly a 14th century MSS, and in my opinion it comes very
late in that century.

The fly-leaf has the following inscription in a modern hand,
and the inlr, at present uuaffected hy age, tells of recent work.
