lNTRODUCTlON xxix

There is no further indication, but the little book has been
in the possession of the “Sacro Convento'' for avery long period,
and came under the careful scrutiny of Papini, to whom I am
disposed to attribute the writing upon the title page.

It has never been doubted that Thomas of Celano wrote at
least two lives of St. Francis, and therefore, until within the last
few years, it was taken for granted that this was the one extant
version of the “ second '² life, but a careful study of the Rinaldi-
Amoni editions disclosesa fact, that can scarcely fail to obtain,
that either one or both of these authorities must have had some
other Codex besides that of Assisi to refer to. There was little
hope, however, of the ordinary student discovering any other MS,
for with respect to rnany of the most precious documents in
existence in the monasteries the ordinary person is denied the
knowledge of even their existence, and so the average student of
F ranciscan sources has been obliged to rest satisfied with accepting
as final either the Amoni text or MS. 686 of the Sacro Convento.

Still a certain amount of mystery has always surrounded this
question; for students were face to face with the well-established
fact that, together with the first life by celano, there had been
associated a further treatise as a sort of appendix. In the Rinaldi-v
Antoni edition this is indicated by the inscription on the title page,
which runs as follows :—

“ vrvn sncounn
sao
arnauorx nn varan rnrnnn”

a legend which clearly indicates the close connection between the
text of the Assisi Codex and the Legenda Gregorii.

It has been moreover noticed that the Legenda Antiqua
was accompanied hya covering letter which commenced “Placuit
Sancti Universitati vestrae,⁷' etc, and as that letter is found at the
commencement of the Assisi Codex and also of the version called
the “second life” by Rinaldi and Antoni, it would naturally
follow that the Legenda Antiqua, the appendix to the first life
and the Vita Secunda of Rinaldi and Amoni, are all one and the
sarne.

Before, however, accepting this, we have to ask ourselves,
What is the irnport of the life written between 1247 and 1257,
which was accompanied by the covering letter “Religiosa nostra
solicitudo,” eto, already called Secundar Traditus?
